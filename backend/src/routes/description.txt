Usually, you could create a single Route file here to manage all your app related routes but it is recommended to create multiple route files which could be categorised like:

Website Routes
API Routes
Authentication Routes
Documentation Routes
etc. Above is more scalable as well as manageable. Here's a code sample for the above:



const express = require("express");
...
const websiteRoutes = require("@routes/Website.routes");
const apiRoutes = require("@routes/Api.routes");

...

app.use("/", websiteRoutes);
app.use("/api", apiRoutes);
